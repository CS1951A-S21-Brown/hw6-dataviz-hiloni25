    <h1>Written Questions:</h1>
    <p>1. My dashboard shows a visual represntation of the above questions. My first graph pie chart shows each genre in Netflix and the count of title as well as percentile when clicked on the genre. I selected pie chart since it can easily visualize all the genres and give a count of each genre as well as makes it really easy to see the maximum count(the one with bigger region in pie chart). I have also added percentile for each genre making it easier for the user to understand the percentile for each genre.
    For my second graph, I showed a bar graph representation to easily see the average duration time for each movies. I have also given a filter bar to allow user to choose the year range and see the counts for that range particularly. For my third graph, I have visualized the network graph with each node as an actor and link is the movie they have acted in common. This network graph easily visualized the actors and their common movies with links,
    and prints name of each actor when a user hovers over it.This visualization makes it easy to determine which actors acted in movies together.I have also added zoom and drag features to allow user to easy move around and find the actor node.For this graph, I am only visulizing first 100 nodes since with thousands of nodes, it is very hard to clearly see the actors and links.</p>
    <p>2. Three reasons why D3 is a helpful library to improve visualization-
    1. D3 Visualization allows to visualize and represent data well using various plots such as bar, scatter, network, etc.
    2. D3 visualization allows us to add interactive components to allow user to inteact in real time and understand each data well
    3. D3 Visualization updates in realtime based on the selection of the user or as filtered by user which makes it easier for user when they want to view only specific data.</p>
    <p>3. Three reasons why D3 is not the best tool for visualization-
    1. For larger chunk of data(like graph 3), it becomes really hard to visualize millions of data since it takes long time to add all the data and visualize.So, the user will need to wait till the entire network loads in.
    2. When trying to visualize large chunk of data, it becomes hard to find some variable as well as makes it very difficult to understand such visualizations.
    3. If the data is not represnted using the best graph, it might make it very hard for user to understand.
    </p>
    <p>4. I have selected the color scheme from the coolors.co taking into consideration the color blind people. Thus, the dashboard should be accessible
    by color blind audiences as well. The color of filter bar and some other regions except the charts doesn't completely take color blind scheme into consideration hence such part might be hard to access by color blind audience. As mentioned in the reading 'A comprehensive Guide Accessible Data Visualization', Deuteranomaly/Protonomaly gets confusedbetween red and green colors. Hence, I have tried to avoid using such colors in graphs making it more accessible for the user. It could be further expanded for audience with some other color blindness issues.</p>
    <p>5. To make my design more accessible to people, I added filter, so people can see the required data very easily. Additionally I made sure to add labels throughout my dashboard making it easier for user to understand all the graphs and their data. I added some interactive components which allows user to hover over some data and give description or value of that data. Lastly, to make it easier for color-blind audience, I used colors in the palatte which is easily accessible by Protanopia audiences. Some additional features could have been added to make it accessible to all audiences with color blindness. The reason was that I couldn't make it accessible to all color blind audience, so I decided to choose the color palatte for audience Protanopia. Some design decisions can be made so it could be easily accessible by all the color blind audiences.
